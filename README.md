The main Carcass 3D renderer, written with OpenGL, used for our projects that require graphics.
It's open-source, and free-to-use for your own projects, but for commercial projects, please contact us first at our email, linked on my profile.

# Can I contribute?

Yes, of course you can! Just fork the repository, and do your changes! You can also then open a pull request, and we will review it.

# Why the name?

Well it's more of a joke, that it's gonna be so horribly name, that it will cause your PC to internally combust. 
However this theory proved wrong, and it runs fast, with low memory, and GPU usage.
